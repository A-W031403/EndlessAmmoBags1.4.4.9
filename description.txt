Open to adding modded ammos if I can figure it out. Also open to adding some or all infinite consumables. I added a number of things this time, I would appreciate comments on any issues you find :)

Loose ToDo: In-game config, Celeb2 support, New Clentam Solutions show sprites, Fix up some textures

Enjoy :)


If you would like to modify this yourself, I will try to update this repository often: https://github.com/A-W031403/EndlessAmmoBags1.4.4.9


Changelog:

v1.0 - Ported mod to 1.4.4.9 and added tooltips

v1.1 - Added list of included items

v1.2 - Created recipe for endless tungsten bullet pouch. Also created a tungsten projectile that is used when firing either tungsten bullets or the modded tungsten pouch.
	   This new projectile replaces the default projectile for tungsten bullets--musket shot--which I though was boring.

v1.3 - Added Endless Fallen Star Pouch

v1.3.1 - Star Pouch is now crafted with 1500 stars, however, it requires the crystal ball & therefore hardmode. Will probably look into making a config which will easily allow editing how many of each item is required. Ideally setting it to max would disable that item.

v1.4 - Rocket Tiers I, II, III, IV added. Endless Gel Tank Added. ToDo: Configuration/settings menu, add Celebration Mk.II support, add more endless projectile bags for misc ammos

v1.4.1 - Added a public repository

v1.4.2 - Added a variation of basic endless bag crafting to also be available at worchbench. I noticed an issue where the endless star bag doesn't cause stars to bounce off bosses in For the Worthy; I'll try to fix this if possible.

v1.5 - Added an endless/bottomless item for all ammunition types (except ale), including Clen. Solutions. There is an already known issue with the yellow, white, and brown solutions where the sprite for the projectile(s) doesn't appear; They still work, just no sprite. I have no idea why :)
