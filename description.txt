			**** None of these 4 will work with the Celebration Mk.II; I know why but can't figure out how to fix it yet.
				 Not sure if it will be unstable, avoid trying :)

Open to adding more vanilla ammo types (and modded, if its easy enough).

Enjoy :)

If you would like to modify this yourself, I will try to update this repository often: https://github.com/A-W031403/EndlessAmmoBags1.4.4.9

Changelog:

v1.0 - Ported mod to 1.4.4.9 and added tooltips

v1.1 - Added list of included items

v1.2 - Created recipe for endless tungsten bullet pouch. Also created a tungsten projectile that is used when firing either tungsten bullets or the modded tungsten pouch.
	   This new projectile replaces the default projectile for tungsten bullets--musket shot--which I though was boring.

v1.3 - Added Endless Fallen Star Pouch

v1.3.1 - Star Pouch is now crafted with 1500 stars, however, it requires the crystal ball & therefore hardmode. Will probably look into making a config which will easily allow editing how many of each item is required. Ideally setting it to max would disable that item.

v1.4 - Rocket Tiers I, II, III, IV added. Endless Gel Tank Added. ToDo: Configuration/settings menu, add Celebration Mk.II support, add more endless projectile bags for misc ammos

v1.4.1 - Added a public repository
